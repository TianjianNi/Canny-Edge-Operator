# Canny-Edge-Operator
Implement the Canny’s Edge Detector with the following four steps: Gaussian smoothing, gradient operation, non-maxima suppression and thresholding.

# How to run the program
To run the program, you will need to ensure that you have the following libraries installed on your system: OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
The algorithm has been tested using the following input files:

• Peppers.bmp

• Goldhill.bmp

To replicate the testing process, please make sure that you have these files in the same directory as the script. Then, run the script and verify that the output matches the expected result.

In main.py, replace the file name with testing image file name.
